1. Cannot fetch pages from CNET.com
There was an error on fetching URL of cnet.com, simply because the website has been updated. So, changed targed to http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/ craigslist.

2. "require "resque"" -> "resque" not found
gem install resque

3. radis connection error
brew update
brew install redis
(not gem)

4. Create Rakefile
make it own:
load (file)
load (file)
require "resque/tasks"


5. Start task queing to redis using resque

radis-server -> (start server)
PIDFILE=./resque-extract.pid BACKGROUND=yes QUEUE=recipe_extract rake resque:work
PIDFILE=./resque-fetch.pid BACKGROUND=yes QUEUE=recipe_fetch rake resque:work

Don't know how to build task 'resque:work' -> add require 'resque/tasks' to Rakefile
